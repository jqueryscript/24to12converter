# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **24-Hour to 12-Hour Time Converter** web application that provides bidirectional time conversion between 24-hour and 12-hour AM/PM formats. The application is built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

## Key Files & Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with SEO optimization, schema markup, and responsive layout
- `script.js` - Core JavaScript logic for time conversion, input handling, and UI interactions
- `src/input.css` - Tailwind CSS source file with imports
- `dist/output.css` - Compiled Tailwind CSS output (generated by build process)
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and build scripts

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build Tailwind CSS (generates dist/output.css)
npm run build

# Run tests (currently no tests configured)
npm test
```

## Architecture & Key Features

### Core Conversion Logic (`script.js:161-224`)
- **convert24to12()**: Converts 24-hour format to 12-hour AM/PM format
- **convert12to24()**: Converts 12-hour AM/PM format to 24-hour format
- Handles various input formats (with/without colons, different AM/PM formats)

### Input Handling (`script.js:80-143`)
- Real-time input formatting and validation
- Keydown filtering for 24-hour mode
- Automatic conversion on valid input

### UI Components
- Bidirectional conversion toggle
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Example buttons for quick testing
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Comprehensive FAQ and conversion chart

## Styling & Design
- Uses **Tailwind CSS v4** with typography plugin
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Clean, accessible interface with proper ARIA labels

## SEO & Schema Markup
- Comprehensive SEO meta tags
- JSON-LD structured data (WebSite, SoftwareApplication, FAQPage)
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Canonical URL and favicon

## Deployment
- Static site deployment (no build process required for HTML/JS)
- CSS must be built before deployment: `npm run build`
- Live site: https://24to12converter.com

## Development Notes
- No testing framework currently configured
- All functionality in vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Focus on accessibility and user experience
- Input validation handles edge cases and malformed inputs
