### Part 1: High-Impact Content Additions

  - **Description:** Create a comprehensive HTML table that displays the conversion for every hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
  - **Benefit:** Catches users looking for a quick visual reference instead of a tool. Excellent for SEO ranking on terms like "time conversion chart".

- **[ ] Expand Explanations Below the Tool:**
  - **Description:** Write clear, concise paragraphs for the following topics:
    - *What is 24-Hour Time?* (Explain its use in various fields).
    - *Understanding AM vs. PM* (Clarify the meaning and how they relate to the 24-hour cycle).
    - *How to Convert 24-Hour to 12-Hour Time Manually* (Provide a simple step-by-step guide).
  - **Benefit:** Answers common user questions directly on the page, increasing time-on-page and capturing more informational search queries.

- **[ ] Create a "Military Time" Section or Page:**
  - **Description:** As you mentioned, "military time" is a related but distinct keyword. Create a dedicated section explaining that the 24-hour format is often called Military Time in the US. Explain any subtle differences if applicable.

### Part 2: Feature Enhancements

These features will improve the user experience and differentiate the tool from basic converters.

- **[ ] Add a "Print Chart" Button:**

  - **Benefit:** Provides real-world utility for users who need a physical copy of the conversion chart.

- **[ ] Implement URL-Based Conversions:**
  - **Description:** Allow the time to be passed as a URL parameter to pre-fill the converter. For example: `.../index.html?time=20:15`.
  - **Benefit:** Allows users to share specific conversions easily.

- **[ ] Add a "Swap" or "Reverse" Button:**
  - **Description:** A button that switches the converter's mode from 24h→12h to 12h→24h.
  - **Benefit:** Doubles the tool's utility and captures users searching for the reverse conversion, keeping them on your site.

  - **Benefit:** Improves click-through rate from search engine results pages.

- **[ ] Add Structured Data (Schema Markup):**
